# Welcome
Welcome to my blog. These posts represent my own views and opinions about
software development. Now that disclaimers are out of the way... I love software
development! I have been doing it for 29 years. Professionally for 21. I wrote
my first bit of software when I was 9 years old. It printed _Hello World_ on the
screen and was written in QBasic.  

I didn't build this blog using a standard blog platform. I wanted a platform
that used a GitHub repo as the foundation and rendered the contents of markdown
stored there-in into static HTML files.  

To achieve this, I used [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org). It uses
[VueJS](https://vuejs.org) which I like, and have been working with for the last
year. I use Azure Web Apps to host the site, and Azure DevOps for Continuous
Integration when changes are committed on GitHub.

With all of that said, I'm going to stop waffling and let you get to some blog
posts.

## Posts
I don't have a fancy way of creating a post listing yet, so this is just a
manually maintained list for now.
